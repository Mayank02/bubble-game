# UI Application for bubble game

Create a simple bubble screen

Contains: 

* ES6 - 7 Support with Babel
* Redux dev tools to help you keep track of the app's state
* Routing
* hot module replacement support so you can change modules or react components without having to reload the browser
* a webpack production config so you can build the app and make it ready for production
* Sass support, just import your styles wherever you need them
* eslint to keep your js readable


# Run the app

0. ```npm install```
0. ```npm start```

Once running, if you want to hide the redux dev monitor: ```CTRL+H```

Yes, it takes a while to load the first time you open the app.

The app updates without the browser having to reload. You don't lose state!

This will build the app into the "dist" directory in the root of the project. It contains the index.html along with the minified assets, ready for production.
